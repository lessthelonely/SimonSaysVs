This is a multiplayer game based on the kid's toy called *Simon Says* that makes the game multiplayer. It is made in C for the Minix Operating System.

If the reader wishes to see the game in action, please refer to the documentation inside the ***proj/doc*** folder, where PDFs with all the relevant information can be found and also how to play the game. To see the game in action, you can just watch the demonstration video.

## Demonstration Video on YouTube

We took a chance at making a more well produced video than the ones we found online - on _YouTube_ and other _Git_ repositories -, as we found that most of them were unpleasantly basic.

We managed to produce the video, and it is _very_ big in size, so we couldn't upload it here on _Git_. We did the next best thing and uploaded it on _YouTube_.

We strongly advise the viewer to have some patience and watch the video in the highest quality _YouTube_ provides or the highest quality their Internet connection allows.
